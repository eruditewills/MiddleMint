# Introduction

The Web3 space moves fast, communities spin up overnight, bounties drop in Discord threads, and contributors jump on projects from anywhere in the world. But one thing still lags behind: getting paid. Right now, Web3 jobbers face a mess of payment pain points:

* Slow and inconsistent payouts. Some DAOs pay monthly, others ghost you.
* High gas fees. Sending $100 and paying $15 to receive it? That’s broken.
* No trust layer. Unless you know the client, you’re gambling every time.
* Cross-border hurdles. Freelancers in emerging markets get hit with extra fees or can’t even access the tokens they earn.
* Poor user experience, managing wallets, chains, and conversions. It’s overwhelming for newcomers and frustrating for veterans.

Ironically, we’re building the decentralized future with a broken financial backend. Web3 promises freedom and fairness, but the payment systems often feel like a step backward.

Freelancers and contributors deserve better. They deserve a system designed around their reality, fast-paced, global, and decentralized. They need a way to get paid that feels as modern as the work they’re doing.

That’s the problem Middlemint is here to solve.
