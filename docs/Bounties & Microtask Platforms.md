# Bounties & Microtask Platforms

Many Web3 projects use bounty boards for small tasks, bug fixes, design jobs, writing, etc. These are often low-value but high-frequency payments, which most tokens and chains aren't optimized for. Middlemint makes it easy to:

* Distribute fast, gas-light payments
* Track task completions with payout triggers
* Integrate directly with task platforms like Dework, Layer3, or custom boards
