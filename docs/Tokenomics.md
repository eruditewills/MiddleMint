# Tokenomics

The $MDMT token is the native utility token for Middlemint, 
a web3 freelance platform on Solana that connects developers, jobbers, and employers through secure, transparent work tracking, 
smart contract escrows, and fair payments. The tokenomics model adopts a 
hybrid approach, emphasizing community rewards (40% allocation), long-term incentives via staking (16%), and ecosystem reserves for sustainable growth. It balances scarcity with a fixed 1B total supply, deflationary elements (implied through vesting and reserves), and strong utility to drive demand. Key focus areas include sustainability, reduced volatility via vesting, and alignment of stakeholders through governance and rewards.

__Total Supply__

1,000,000,000 (1B) $MDMT tokens. This fixed cap ensures long-term scarcity while supporting ecosystem expansion and rewards.

__Allocation Breakdown__

Allocations are designed to prioritize community and 
ecosystem development (over 75% non-team/advisors).
The breakdown includes vesting details for transparency:

__Vesting Schedules__

Vesting promotes long-term alignment and prevents early sell pressure:
* Team: 0% at TGE, 6-month cliff, linear over 24 months (4.17% monthly).
* Advisors: 0% at TGE, 1-month cliff, linear over 12 months (8.33% monthly).
* Community Rewards & Airdrops: ~2% at TGE, no cliff, linear over 48 months (2.04% monthly; activity-based releases likely).
* Ecosystem Reserves: 0% at TGE; cliff, vesting, and unlocks determined by DAO governance.
* CEX & DEX Liquidity: 100% at TGE, no vesting (for immediate trading depth).
* Staking & Incentives: 0% at TGE, 2-month cliff, linear over 48 months (2.08% monthly; tied to participation).

__Token Utilities__

$MDMT integrates as a multi-utility token to drive platform engagement and value accrual:

* Payments & Fees: Primary currency for job payments, escrows, and transaction fees on the platform, ensuring instant, low-cost settlements on Solana.
* Rewards & Airdrops: Allocated for community incentives, including seasonal airdrops, bounties for creators/hackers, and activity-based rewards (e.g., quests, referrals, contributions).
* Staking & Loyalty: Users stake $MDMT for yields, bonuses, enhanced visibility in job matching, fee rebates, and access to premium features like exclusive NFTs or early tool access.
* Governance: Enables DAO voting on ecosystem decisions, such as reserve allocations, platform upgrades, and collaborations.
* On-Chain Reputation: Builds verifiable proof-of-work (e.g., as on-chain CVs or badges) for freelancers, enhancing trust and unlocking higher-paying opportunities.

__Additional Notes__

* Initial Circulating Supply: 123,670,000 tokens at TGE (~12.37% of total supply), providing balanced liquidity without oversupply.
* Market Metrics: Listing Price: $0.0500; Initial Market Cap (IMC) without Liquidity: $683,500; IMC with Liquidity: $6,183,500; Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV): $50,000,000.
* Economic Model: Hybrid with community focus (40% for rewards/airdrops); no explicit inflation, but emissions through incentives are controlled via vesting. Risks managed via DAO and on-chain transparency.
