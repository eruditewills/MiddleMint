# Mission & Vision
At Middlemint, our mission is simple: Make getting paid in Web3 as easy, fast, and fair as doing the work.

We’re building a token that puts the needs of Web3 jobbers first. Whether you're a freelance dev contributing to a DAO, a community manager running Telegram, or an artist cranking out memes and designs, you deserve a payment system that works as hard as you do.

Middlemint was born from the frustration we've all felt trying to chase down clients, deal with gas fees, or wait days just to get compensated. Our mission is to remove the friction, make payments instant and borderless, and give workers the confidence that when the job’s done, the payment is already on the way.

As part of our vision, we imagine a world where:

Work is decentralized, but getting paid isn’t chaotic.

Contributors anywhere, from Nairobi to New York, can earn and spend with no middlemen or barriers.

DAOs and Web3 projects can plug into a clean, reliable payment layer with zero headaches.

Jobbers are rewarded fairly, with loyalty systems and real incentives for long-term engagement.

Middlemint isn’t just another token. It’s the economic backbone for a global, on-demand Web3 workforce. A tool that makes hiring, rewarding, and retaining contributors seamless, not a source of stress.

We’re not here to be the next hype coin. We’re here to fix something real and build a token that jobbers will actually use, every single day.
